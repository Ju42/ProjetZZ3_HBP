# Intro The general topic of the project
Since 2013,the European Commission has set up a flagship project in the field of neuroscience: The Human Brain Project (HBP). The HBP aims to implement a cutting-edge research infrastructure for a better understanding of brain and cognitive neuroscience. To reach this goal, the HBP makes available a platform designed to give the scientific community an access to two systems that emulate brain function: SpiNNaker and BrainScaleS. To make effective use of these systems, we need to compare them to have a profile of each platform referencing their architecture, their performance and how configurable the system is.

# Methods
We have done some extensive research on both simulators to understand their hardware and software architectures. We mainly used the Internet to access platform-specific documentation and scientific papers and surveys. The next step was to try to setup emulators available to test the code on our personal laptop computers before running it on the real remote systems. Finally, we had to execute benchmarking codes on the simulators and compare their performance results.
# Results
The first challenge was to search among a significant mass of information about SpiNNaker whereas very little documentation is available regarding BrainScaleS. During the second step, we encountered additional issues: there is no functionnal hardware emulator for the current SpiNNaker platform and we were unable to make the BrainScaleS simulator works properly on our laptops. We suspect some issues in the configuration of the virtual machine running the emulator. We managed to execute a simple code representing a synfire chain neural network on the SpiNNaker from the web platform. Unfortunately, this does not give us access to the detailed execution. 
# Conclusion
Both simulators seem to be interesting but it is obvious that SpiNNaker is at a higher stage in its developpement. Thus, we focused on this platform which gave us some interesting but insufficient results to analyze the performances.[309]
