Utilisation de la platforme Neuromorphic Computiong Platform du Human Brain Project

# Intro The general topic of the project

* Compare two Humain Brain simulations platform
* Search informations about it
* Search haow to use it
* in which mesure we can control the simulation ? What we can parametrise ?
* What performance can we get ?

* Make the profiling of both platform ?

# Methods

* First research about both simulators : internet, scientific articles, documentations
* Next try to use simulators of both Hardwares
* Then use the simulators

# Results

* There much more data (scientific articles and documentation) about SpiNNaker
  than BrainScaleS
* There isn't functionnal hardware simulator for the actul SpiNNaker platform.
  We haven't find how to use the BrainScaleS simulator (some trouble maybe in
  the configuration of the VM in which use the simulator)
* COMMING SOON : results with SpiNNaker platform

# Conclusion

Both simulators seems to be interesting but it's obvious that SpiNNaker is at a
higher state in it's developpement and evolution. So we focus our self on that
platform which gave us some interesting result ....(TODO)
