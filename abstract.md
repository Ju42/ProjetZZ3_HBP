# Title: Using the Neuromorphic Computing Platform of the Human Brain Project

# Intro The general topic of the project
Since 2013,the European Commission has set up a flagship project in the field of neuroscience: The Human Brain Project (HBP). The HBP aims to implement a cutting-edge research infrastructure for a better understanding of brain and cognitive neuroscience. To reach this goal, the HBP makes available a platform designed to give the scientific community an access to two computer systems that emulate brain function. To make effective use of these systems, we need to compare them to have a profile of each platform referencing their architecture, their performance and how configurable the system is.

# Methods
* First research about both simulator to undertand their hardware and software architectures : we mainly search on Internet, and read scientific articles and documentations. Then, summarize what we found in reports. Search how to use it
* Next try to setup emulators and simulators available to test the code before running it on the real systems.
* Then run benchmarking codes on the simulators and compare performance results.

# Results

* The first challenge was to search among a significant mass of information about SpiNNaker whereas very little documentation is available concerning BrainScaleS
    
* There is no functionnal hardware simulator for the current SpiNNaker platform.
  We have not find how to use the BrainScaleS simulator (maybe some issues in the configuration of the VM in which use the simulator)
* COMMING SOON : results with SpiNNaker platform

# Conclusion

Both simulators seem to be interesting but it is obvious that SpiNNaker is at a higher stage in its developpement and evolution. Thus, we focus on this platform which gave us some interesting results ....(TODO)
